Springer is giving out free books. Go get them.

## Usage

### Option 1
Run the python script as `$ python get_books.py` to download both PDFs and Ebooks.

This will name every file and separate them in folders.

### Option 2
(This method might be faster, but I haven't checked it.)

To download the files without names (numbers),
first do `$ chmod +x get_books_XXX.sh` to run the scripts.

Then, run the bash scripts as:
```
$ ./get_books_PDF.sh 
$ ./get_books_EPUB.sh 
```
