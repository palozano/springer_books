Springer is giving out free books

## Usage

### Option 1
Run the python script as `$ python get_books.py` to download both PDFs and Ebooks.

This will name every file and separate them in folders.

### Option 2
Run the bash script to download only the PDF version (possibly faster) but
without names.
