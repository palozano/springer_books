Springer is giving out free books. Go get them.

## Usage

### Option 1
Run the python script as `$ python get_books.py` to download both PDFs and Ebooks.

This will name every file and separate them in folders.

### Option 2
Run the bash script as `$ ./get_books.sh` (do `$ chmod +x get_books.sh` if didn't work) to download only the PDF version (possibly faster) but without names.
